Give a grid to this sudoku resolving program so it can fill it.

The program looks for the best value to put in the most constraint box.
When multiple values are possible, it tries the first one and goes on.
When it reaches a dead end, it comes back and tries another value.

Even if it works, it could be written better so it runs faster.
I will fix all this, adding multithreading and then remotely executing.
