Give a grid to this sudoku resolving program so it can fill it.

Each time the program can put multiple values in a box, it tries the first one.
When it reaches a dead end, it comes back and tries another value.

Even if it works, it could be written better so it runs faster.
I will fix all this, adding multithreading and then remotely executing.
